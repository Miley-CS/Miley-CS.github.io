git steps

1. Create some files in a directory (folder)
2. git init (starts repository (storage))
3. git add . (adds to stage)
4. git commit -m "message" (make a commitment, save in history)
5. git push origin master (puts in live GitHub repository, origin = original, master = main branch)

git facts

- Git is for saving different histories of your code
- git helps you work on the same code on different computers with different people
- local = own computer, not live/online
- remote = somewhere else far, in computer terms it's stored somewhere public/live
